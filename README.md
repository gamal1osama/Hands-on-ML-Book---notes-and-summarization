## Exercises & Practice

At the end of each chapter:
- You’ll find **hands-on exercises** to reinforce your learning.
- The **solutions** are available at the end of the corresponding notebook for each chapter (in the official GitHub repo or Colab).

I highly recommend **solving the exercises yourself first** before checking the solutions.
